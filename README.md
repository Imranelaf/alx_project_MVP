# Python Flask E-Commerce Website

A simple e-commerce website using Flask, Jinja2, SQLite, jQuery, Bootstrap and Python.

The application loads a gallery of shoes items that includes: image, name and price. The clothing information is stored in a SQLite database and is displayed using Bootstrap's card class.

The application contains filters that were implemented through SQLite queries so that the user can scroll through the items according to different categories such as, Shirts, Pants, Shoes, Price etc.

### Run as Python application 

Go to the same directory as the main application and run the following

```bash
python wsgi.py
```
